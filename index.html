		 <p> Life doesn't come with a roadmap and we can feel lost or moving in the wrong direction. We want to reach our goals, but often miss the target of our dreams and aspirations. Perhaps we've taken a wrong turn or find ourselves on a path completely different than we imagined.
			 <br><br>
			 
			 Suddenly, life is no longer meaningful. We've lost our motivation. We're confused and uncertain. It seems like our creative spark has completely disappeared. 
			 <br><br>Life is just <i><b>blah</b></i>
			 <br> <br>
			 
	
	Ask yourself: Are you smiling less? Frustrated by little annoyances? Then it's time to consider taking a new life path. You owe it to yourself to reclaim your joy.
			 <br><br>
			 Thankfully, Compass Coaching offers the guidance you need to find your way back to a healthy balanced lifestyle. <br><br> <b>Can a Life Coach really help?</b><br><br>
